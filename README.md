# Python2-Black-Jack
I advise that the following program be used in Jupyter Notebook, but ideally any Python2 IDE should be compatible.

Each round of betting is initiliazed by 'Play()'. When you begin a new round, data from all previous rounds is kept, including your account balance. 

Note: Should you run out of money, use the command 'play_money = amount' to grant yourself more money.
