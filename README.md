# Python-Black-Jack
I advise that the following program be used in Jupyter Notebook, but ideally any Python IDE should be compatible. If you are using Python3, the only change you'd need to make is to switch all the "rawinput"s to "input". 

Each round of betting is initiliazed by 'Play()'. When you begin a new round, data from all previous rounds is kept, including your account balance. 

Note: Should you run out of money, use the command 'play_money = amount' to grant yourself more money.
